# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

   I had to look back at the lesson for syntax quite a bit, so just remembering how everything needs
   to be typed out will take more repetition.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

   I need to be better about listing out how things are written from the lesson page so I can just look back at my notebook when going through the challenges.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

   I would say googling and looking at the ruby documentation when I am not sure of something.
